Generates DTO's and DAO's from the database connection.

Generated files are placed in a directory named "output".

You must create a file named "connection.properties" and place it in the
application's root directory.  The following properties must be defined:

driver
url
username
password
tables

The following is an example using IBM informix:
----
driver=com.informix.jdbc.IfxDriver
url=jdbc:informix-sqli://localhost:9088/appdb:INFORMIXSERVER=ol_informix1170;DB_LOCALE=en_us.utf8
username=appdbuser
password=appdbpassword
tables=%

You can restrict which tables are used by changing the "tables" specification.
For example "app%" would only use the tables starting with the characters "app".
